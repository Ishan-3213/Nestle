This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we collect from or about our consumers through the methods described in this section. This Privacy Notice does NOT apply to information collected by our affiliate companies, or joint venture partners. Please note we may combine personal information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website) with personal information that we collect via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more customization. Nestl\u00e9 websites This refers to any consumer-directed websites operated by Nestl\u00e9, including websites that we operate under our own domains/URLs and websites that we run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g. Facebook fan page). Nestl\u00e9 mobile sites/applications This refers to any consumer-directed mobile sites or applications operated by Nestl\u00e9, including our smartphone apps (e.g., iPhone apps). Nestl\u00e9 electronic messaging programs This refers to any consumer-directed electronic messaging programs operated by Nestl\u00e9 including e-mail, text and other electronic messages. These programs might be advertised on one of our websites or applications or in a print ad. Offline registration cards This refers to printed registration and similar cards that we may collect from consumers via, for example, postal mail, in-store demos, contests and other promotions or other offline events. Call centers This refers to personal information that we may collect from consumers through our call centres, for example if you call us with a question or comment or to sign up for marketing communications over the phone. Advertising interactions. Interactions with our advertisements (e.g., if you interact with on one of our ads on a third party website, we may receive information about that interaction). Data We create. In the course of our interactions with you, we may create Personal Data about you (e.g. records of your purchases from our websites). Data from other sources This refers to personal information we may obtain about you from other sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to provide us additional information about our existing consumers (this is known as \u201cdata appending\u201d). We may also receive information from third party co-sponsors who we may occasionally partner with to run special contests or other promotions. We may also receive information about consumers when we acquire other companies, from public sources, from third party social networks and through market research (if feedback is not provided on an anonymous basis). Telemetry Data We may automatically collect data from Nestl\u00e9 commercial coffee machines that are leased to enterprises. This information may include the machine Serial Number, machine alerts or errors, ingredient stock levels, and the number and type of coffees prepared by users, with the respective date and time. This information is associated with the enterprise customer but is not linked to any individual user of the machine. We use this information to determine usage trends and stock levels. 2. What information do we collect? Depending on how you interact with us (online, offline, over the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate), as described in this section. Personal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information that can be used to personally identify you, whether alone or in combination with other available information, whereas aggregate information does not allow for such identification. In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information with account login and/or demographic information) and store them together in our records. In cases, where personal and aggregate information are combined, such information will always be considered as personal information. We strive to limit the amount of personal information we collect and store to that which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally store your personal information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed to provide you the relevant services. We may store your personal information for a longer period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes. Personal contact information This includes any information that would allow us to personally contact you, such as your name, home or mailing address, phone number (home, cell, etc.), or email address. In some cases, this could include personal information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you provide a friend\u2019s email address for a tell-a-friend program). We typically collect personal contact information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website and social community features, online purchases, consumer service inquiries, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys.

Examples may include your login ID/email address, screen name, password, and/or security question and answer.

Your login information, especially your password, should be kept confidential and never shared with anyone else.

Demographic information This includes any information that describes your demographic or psychographic characteristics. Examples may include your date of birth, age or age range, gender, geographic location (e.g., zip code, city and state, mobile location), favourite products, hobbies and interests, and household or lifestyle information.

It may include information about your children\u2019s genders, feeding styles, birthdates, or expected due dates. It may include information about work status or professional credentials. It may also include information about your pets and pet preferences. We may collect demographic information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website and social community registration, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, you may be allowed to modify certain demographic information stored under your account.

Technical computer information This includes any information about the computer system or other technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites or applications. We typically collect this information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. Examples of technical computer information may include your computer\u2019s IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Nestl\u00e9 website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phone\u2019s unique device ID, geo-location and other similar mobile device data. Website usage information This includes information about how you use and navigate our websites and applications, including which links you click on, which pages or content you view and for how long, and other similar information and statistics about your interactions with a Nestl\u00e9 website or application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from, favourite recipes and site activities, high game scores, etc.). This information is captured using automated tracking technologies such as browser cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, and may also be collected through the use of third party tracking services (such as Google Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such as number of visits to a particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site). We may also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the email is opened, where user links to from the email, etc.). Please see\u00a0Question 8 (\u201cTracking technologies \u2013 How and why do we use them?\u201d). Please note that \u201cflash\u201d cookies are different from \"browser\u201d cookies because of the way in which flash cookies capture and store data. Your browser\u2019s cookie management tools will not remove flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118 We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We use tracking tools to serve you with interest-based advertising and to better understand your behaviours and browsing activities. We might permit third parties to gather information passively on our websites, including for behavioral advertising purposes. We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. You can control tracking tools. In particular, your browser gives you the ability to delete or reject browser cookies. If you block cookies, certain features on our website may not work. Some browsers have a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so note that our systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this Privacy Notice will stop. Consumer feedback This includes information that you voluntarily share with us about your experience in using our products and services, including our websites and applications. Examples may include unsolicited comments and suggestions, testimonials, or other questions or feedback related to our products. We typically collect this information in the form of consumer surveys, consumer panels, contact forms, \u201cAsk the Expert\u201d forms, and email correspondence. Consumer-generated content This refers to any content that you create and then share with us (and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites or applications, including one of our Facebook sites. Examples may include photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We may collect and publish consumer-generated content in connection with a variety of activities, including contests and other promotions, website community features, consumer engagement, and third party social networking. Social network information This refers to any information that you share publicly on a third-party social network or is part of your profile on a third party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the third party social network to share with us. Examples include your basic account information (e.g. name, email address, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third party social network to share with third party application developers. For example, we may receive your social network profile information (or parts of it) every time you download or interact with a Nestl\u00e9 web application on a social network such as Facebook or every time you use a social networking feature that is integrated within a Nestl\u00e9 website (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your information from a third party social network may be obtained by us (or other third party application developers), please visit the website of the relevant social network. You further acknowledge that we may use your personal information to match information with a social network for advertising purposes (see \u201cMarketing communications\u201d under\u00a0Question 3\u00a0of this Privacy Notice). Payment information This includes any information that you use to make a purchase, such as your credit card details (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, etc.) or other forms of payment (if such are made available). This also includes the billing name and address associated with your form of payment. If you create an account with us when making a purchase, your payment information may be stored under your account profile.

We ensure that the ways in which any personal information is collected via our CCTV systems are compliant with all applicable privacy protection laws and are limited only to the extent that is necessary to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. If you have further questions pertaining to our collection of CCTV information,please contact our Chief Privacy Officer atConsumer.care@ca.nestle.com. DNA Data.Nestl\u00e9 collects and analyzes your genetic information, including DNA information, when you choose to share it with us. You must share yourwww.23andMe.comor ANCESTRY.COM data file with Nestl\u00e9 to take advantage of this service. Other information (depending on context) This refers to any other information that we might need to collect for a specific Nestl\u00e9 form, feature, or other service that you use or request. What this information includes will vary depending on the method of collection and the specific purpose(s) for which the information is being collected. Please see Question 3\u00a0(\u201cHow do we use your information?\u201d) for more specific examples. 3. How do we use your personal information? The following paragraphs describe the various purposes and features for which we might collect and use your personal information, and the different types of information that might be collected from you through the different methods described in\u00a0Question 1 above. Please note that not all of the uses below will be relevant to every consumer. Account maintenance We may use your personal information to maintain your accounts with us, including administering any consumer loyalty, rewards or membership programs that are associated with your account. This typically involves the use of personal information that was originally collected to set up your account (e.g., personal contact information, payment information, account login information, demographic information, etc.). Consumer service We may collect and use your personal information to provide you consumer service, including responses to your inquiries. This typically requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as your name or email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product question/complaint, general question, etc.). Consumer service may be provided through various forms of communication, including email correspondence, call centre support, social communities and live online chat features. Product improvement and customization We may collect and use your personal information so we can constantly improve our products, tailor them to your needs, and come up with new product ideas. This mostly involves the collection and use of demographic information and consumer feedback. Consumer engagement We may collect and use your personal information to get you more actively engaged with our products and services (including our websites and applications), thereby increasing overall brand engagement and awareness. This mostly involves the collection, use, and publication of consumer-generated content, profile information, promotional activity, engagement with our websites & digital content. Contests and other promotions We may collect and use your personal information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfilment), demographic information (for eligibility determination), and, in some instances, consumer-generated content. Some of our promotions may be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (for example, on our Facebook fan pages). To comply with legal requirements, we may publish or share a limited amount of personal information (such as name and city of residence) about the winners of a particular promotion. For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details posted with each promotion. Marketing communications We may collect and use your personal information to send you marketing communications, such as email communications, SMS text messages, and postal mailings. Please note that if you choose to receive SMS text messages, your mobile service provider\u2019s fees for messaging will apply. We may also show you marketing communications on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member, by matching activities or information collected on our websites with those collected on third party sites (\u201cTargeted Advertising\u201d). These marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special offers, and promotions from our brands of interest to you. On occasion, these communications may also introduce you to other Nestl\u00e9 brands and inform you about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and demographic information. In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based offers and promotions. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or by contactingConsumer Services. Changing these preferences would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they may provide for Targeted Advertising. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member. Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party (not Nestl\u00e9) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party\u2019s privacy policy. Third party social networking We may collect and use your personal information when you interact with third party social networking features such as \u201cFacebook Connect\u201d or \u201cFacebook Like\u201d. These features may be integrated in our sites or applications for the purposes of running contests, allowing you to share content with friends, or other stated purposes. If you use these features, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your social networking profile (see \u201cSocial network information\u201d under\u00a0Question 2 of this Privacy Notice). You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network. Website improvement and personalization We may collect and use your information to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and applications, to analyze your preferences and habits, to anticipate your needs based on our analysis of your profile, to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and apps, to ensure that content from our website/apps is optimized for you and for your computer or device and to participate in interactive features. This is typically done through automated tracking technologies (please also see Question 8) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID/email address or screen name so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we may also show you specific Nestl\u00e9 content or promotions that are tailored to your interests. Website community features We may collect and use your personal information to give you access to website community features, including features that may allow you to upload and share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork, or other messages or content. This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances) public display of certain personal contact information, account login information, demographic information, and/or consumer-generated content. Because these features are \u201ccommunal\u201d in nature, information or content that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a Nestl\u00e9 site. For some community features, we may give you the ability to control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others. To access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For website community features that have social networking integration (such as \u201cFacebook Connect\u201d), see separate paragraph on \u201cThird party social networking\u201d. Website viral features (e.g. tell-a-friend) We may request and use your personal information so you can use website viral features, such as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you to easily share certain news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party social networks (such as Facebook\u2019s \u201cShare\u201d and \u201cLike\u201d features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network for additional information. Order fulfilment We may collect and use your personal information to process and ship your orders, to inform you about the status of your orders, correct addresses and conduct identity verification and other fraud-detection activities. This could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the on-going storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases. Please note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestl\u00e9 products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestl\u00e9. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases on those sites. Other general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research) We may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications, to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies (including using anonymized personal information in a statistical or aggregated form for research and marketing purposes) and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These activities mostly require the collection and use of certain demographic information, technical computer information, website usage information, and consumer feedback. Suppliers/Customers We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for the purposes of assessing and ensuring the credit worthiness of suppliers and customers and for the purpose of determining the continuing viability of such suppliers and customers when entering into or renewing contracts for supply of products to and from such suppliers or customers. 4. How do we protect your personal information? We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as our website and social community features or other social areas. Secure operating environments We store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from the public and that we only allow authorized Nestl\u00e9 employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Also, as part of our standard procedures, your personal information may be stored and processed in jurisdictions outside of your province of residence or outside the country such as the United State and Switzerland. In such cases, we continue to use generally accepted industry standards and secure operating environments to protect your information. However, regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions may be able to gain access to your information pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions. Encryption for payment info We use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive financial information, such as credit card information, sent to us over the web. For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores. Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestl\u00e9 products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestl\u00e9. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases. Prior authentication for account access We require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account. Measures we expect you to take It is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls we may provide you in our website community areas. 5. What happens if you refuse to provide your personal information? If you choose not to submit any personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities and personalized features and you may limit the services and special offers we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you will not be able to receive any of our newsletters or otherwise register on our websites or use our applications. If you refuse to provide your credit card number, you will not be able to purchase products at a Nestl\u00e9 online store. However, to simply browse our websites and learn more about our products, you do not need to give us any personal information. 6. Who do we disclose your personal information to and why? Nestl\u00e9 will not share your personal information with any third party that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless we have specifically informed you and you have given us specific permission to do this. Employees of Nestl\u00e9 may have access to your personal information in the course of providing our services to you. Employee access to personal information will be restricted to those employees who have a legitimate need to know such information for the performance of their employment duties at Nestl\u00e9. We may share your personal information with our subsidiary companies, companies in which Nestl\u00e9 S.A. has control through either direct or indirect ownership (collectively \u201cNestl\u00e9 Group\u201d). Nestl\u00e9 may also share your personal information with third parties, but only in the following circumstances: Service Providers, Agents and Contractors We may use third parties, like service providers, agents or contractors to provide support for the internal operations of our websites and applications and to assist us with administering our websites and applications or the various functions, programs and promotions available to you. Some of these third parties may be located outside the country where you accessed this website. These third parties and its employees may come into contact with your personal information in the course of providing their services to us. Any such third party must at all times provide the same levels of security for your personal information as Nestl\u00e9 and, where required, are bound by a legal agreement to keep your personal information private, secure and to process it only on the specific instructions of Nestl\u00e9. We are part of the Nestl\u00e9 global company. The server that makes this web site available is located outside the country from which you have accessed this web site. Our main hosting provider for most Nestl\u00e9 Web sites is based in the United States. This provider is bound by a contract that ensures a high standard of privacy protection and requires (amongst other provisions) that it act only on Nestl\u00e9 instructions and implements all technical measures necessary on an ongoing basis to keep your personal information secure. Credit reporting agencies/debt collectors.To the extent permitted by applicable law, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors are external companies that we use to help us to verify your creditworthiness (in particular for orders with invoice) or to collect outstanding invoices. Partners and Joint Promotions From time to time, we may run a joint or co-sponsored program or promotion on our website or application with another company, organization, or other reputable third party; and, as part of this event, collect and process personal information. If your personal information is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other than Nestl\u00e9 as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time your personal information is collected. Periodically, we may run a promotion on our website or application that features the products or services of another company and will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information directly from that third party company. When doing any promotion involving another company, we may provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you to read it before you share any personal information, as we cannot guarantee they adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not to opt in or participate in these events at the time the personal information is collected/requested. Legal and Business Transfers We may also disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, to respond to any claims, enforce the terms of any agreement or the terms of our website, or to protect the safety, property, privacy or rights of Nestl\u00e9, its customers, or the public. In the event of a merger or acquisition of all or part of Nestl\u00e9 by another company, or in the event that Nestl\u00e9 were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Nestl\u00e9 business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestl\u00e9 business, which could include personal information. Similarly, personal information may be transferred as part of a corporate reorganization, insolvency proceeding, or other similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law. Health Care Practitioner When you register for an account on one of our websites based upon receiving an invitation to register from your practitioner, we will share your information, including your Genetic Data file, with your practitioner for the purposes of allowing them to make medical recommendations to you based on your Genetic Data. Aggregate Information We may share aggregated demographic or survey information with third parties, but this information is in anonymous form and does not contain any personal information. The aggregate information that we share may include anonymous information that is captured through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technology, as explained in the Question 8\u00a0below. 7. How can you access, modify, or make other choices regarding the use of your personal information? The following outlines the choices you have with respect to the collection and use of your personal information by us. 1.

Simply follow the unsubscribe process or directions provided in the email. Please read our Marketing communications section for limitations on certain administrative communications, order confirmations, and account notifications. 4. Subject to our right to retain certain information (see Question 10) You can always review, update or withdraw consent to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s processing of any personal information that we may have collected about you including for our general website and application registration.

We will respond to all access requests within 30 days or we will notify you when more time is needed to respond. In addition, if you participated in a promotion or program that involved a third party and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party directly to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party\u2019s privacy policy. 8. Tracking Technology \u2013 How and why do we use them? Nestl\u00e9 does make use of tracking technologies (\u201cCookies\u201d, \u201cIP Addresses\u201d, Log Files\u201d, \u201cWeb Beacons\u201d) to gather certain information such as browser type and operating system, referring page, path through site, domain of ISP etc. for the purpose of improving the use and functionality of our websites and other purposes described below. Tracking technologies help us tailor our websites to your personal needs. Cookies We use Cookies to improve the use and functionality of our websites and to better understand how visitors use our websites and the tools and services offered on it and to communicate elsewhere on the web. The storage of Cookies on your computer provides an easy and convenient way for us to personalize or enhance your experience on our websites and to make your next visit more enjoyable. Nestl\u00e9 makes use of third party cookies which are set by third parties for different services (for example, website analytics or advertising).

IP Addresses We may keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to (among other things): (i) troubleshoot technical concerns, (ii) maintain website safety and security, (iii) restrict access to our websites to certain users, and, (iv) better understand how our websites are utilized. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. Log Files We (or a third party on our behalf) may collect information in the form of logs files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us gather (among other things) (i) a user\u2019s browser type and operating system, (ii) information about a user\u2019s session (such as the URL they came from, the date and time they visited our website, and which pages they've viewed on our website and for how long), and, (iii) other similar navigational or click-stream data. We also use information captured in log files for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve and customize the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user. Web Beacons We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or include them in the e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as \u201cweb bugs\u201d) are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data back to us. The information collected via web beacons may include some of the information described in the IP Address section directly above, as well as information about how a user responds to an email campaign (e.g., the time the email is opened, where does the user link to from the email, etc.). We use web beacon information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. 9. E Marketing - What is spamming and what is our position on spam e-mails? Spamming is where unsolicited e-mails are sent to you containing advertisements or marketing related materials without your consent. We do NOT send spam e-mails. Sending e-mails without consent is illegal in Canada. We will not use your personal information (including your e-mail address) for direct e-mail marketing or follow-up communications unless you give us your express opt-in permission or unless we are otherwise permitted to do so under the law. Also, we do not share your personal information with any third party who will use your personal information for illegal spam mails. Nestl\u00e9 websites give you the opportunity to receive marketing information by e-mail. Every marketing e-mail sent by Nestl\u00e9 will give you the opportunity at any time to stop receiving such e-mails.

This means that we may retain your personal information for a reasonable period after you stop using Nestl\u00e9 services or stop using our websites or applications. After this period, your personal information will be deleted from all systems in the Nestl\u00e9 Group. We remind you that you have a right to have your personal information deleted as further set out in Question 7 above. 11. Do we collect personal information from children? We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children below the age of 13. If we discover that we\u2019ve accidentally collected information from a child below 13, we will remove that child\u2019s information from our records as soon as feasibly possible. However, we may collect personal information about children below the age of 13 from the parent or custodian directly and therefore with their explicit consent. 12. Do we link to other third party sites? Our websites and applications may provide links to, or features from, other third party sites (such as independent e-commerce sites and third party social networks). If you link to or use such third party sites or features, you do so at your own risk. We do not control and are not responsible for the content or practices of any third party site, application, or feature. 13.

Essentia Water\u00aeis ionized alkaline water that has a pH of 9.5 or higher with a clean, smooth taste. HOW IS ESSENTIA\u00ae MADE? Essentia Water\u00aeuses a unique, proprietary three-step process. The process begins with purification through reverse osmosis and microfiltration to remove contaminants, followed by the infusion of a mineral blend (i.e. electrolytes) present in trace amounts for taste and to complement the body\u2019s natural mix. Finally, the ionization process removes bitter-tasting ions, which results in a water with a pH of 9.5 or higher with a clean, smooth taste. HOW IS ESSENTIA\u00ae DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ALKALINE WATER? It\u2019s actually what we take out, not what we put in that results in Essentia\u00aeionized alkaline water. Most alkaline waters achieve higher pH from the source (i.e. from minerals that exist based on geographic location and result in higher pH) or from the adding of minerals in (e.g. electrolytes). Essentia\u00aeachieves alkalinity through its proprietary ionization process. This process not only removes bitter-tasting ions, but also raises the pH level to 9.5 or higher and results in a clean and smooth-tasting water. WHERE IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR WATER? We use municipal water supplies, which goes through our three-step proprietary process, including in-depth purification, that transforms it into ionized alkaline water with a pH of 9.5 or higher.

We also make\n\t\t\tnutrition solutions to help you through different life stages. We make it all with a drive to constantly improve\n\t\t\tour products and our company. This is our story Years in themaking! It all started in 1867 with a man named Henri Nutrition has always been at the heart of what we do.

it comes to losing weight, there\u2019s no miracle recipe or magic food that melts fat. So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits\u2026for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you\u2019ll improve your health and daily vitality. Ideas to lighten up your meals Replace the ground beef in your spaghetti sauce with lentils. It\u2019s a great trick to reduce fat content and calories, while increasing fibre, a natural appetite suppressant. On pizza and for other dishes using melted cheese, mix full-fat cheese with low-fat cheese, or mix it with firm shredded tofu instead. No one will be able to tell the difference! And to make the meal even more low-fat and nutritious, double the quantity of vegetables. Substitute pasta by using spaghetti squash, or \u201cspiralize\u201d vegetables such as zucchini or beets. A delicious and refreshing alternative! Do you like cream sauces, such as Alfredo pasta sauce? Try a 5% cream blend for cooking, or use soy plant-based cooking cream for a lower fat version. Replace quiches with omelettes and frittatas. Without crusts, these dishes contain less fat. Containing only 70 calories each, eggs are an excellent weight-loss ally. Two eggs make up a portion. Think about adding them to your salad meals. Note that a healthy adult can have seven eggs weekly. Add edamame beans to your menu more often. Rich in fibre and protein, they prolong the feeling of fullness, reducing cravings. Boil these frozen beans for four to five minutes and they are ready to be added to your salad meals, Asian dishes, soups, and pasta dishes. Nutritious snacks Since fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1]make them a priority at snack-time. Containing twice as much protein as traditional yogurt, 0 or 2% fat Greek yogurt is a perfect snack. Ideally, choose the plain option and flavour it to taste with fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup. Instead of a granola bar, muffin or other commercially prepared bakery product, choose ripe fresh fruit and a few nuts. A much more nourishing and filling combo. Low in calories, try raw vegetables more often. And for a dip, go with plain Greek yogurt with a little pesto. Snack on oven-baked edamame. A great alternative to chips! Need a more filling snack? Go for a hard-boiled egg and some raw vegetables, or make a homemade smoothie with milk or a soy beverage, fresh fruit, and Greek yogurt. No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around! This article has been sponsored by BOOST\u00ae, but all comments and opinions are my own.

Do Drumstick Bites contain nuts? Where can I buy the Drumstick Bites? Are they available online? Do Drumstick Bites need to be frozen? What is the shelf-life of Drumstick Bites? Great question! Drumstick Bites are crispy, crunchy bite-sized mini cones filled with a chocolatey nugget \u2013 just like the end of a classic Drumstick ice cream cone! If you are looking for the Drumstick ice cream page, click herehttps://www.madewithnestle.ca/drumstick Much like your favourite Drumstick Classic ice cream cone, these products do contain nuts (Hazelnut Paste). We always recommend checking the product packaging and ingredient list.

To explore both online and in-store options, select the Products tab in the top banner and click the \"Where to Buy\" button below the flavour you want! A pop-up will provide options for shopping online or locating nearby stores by entering a postal code or city. Happy shopping! \u200b\u200b\u200bNot at all! Drumstick Bites are shelf-stable and can be stored at room temperature, making them a convenient snack anytime! The shelf-life of Drumstick Bites is 12 months. Please refer to the Best Before at the back of the pouch before purchasing.
